This repository contains work samples select from my first and second years of study. 
I have currently included 5 final projects/assignments. 

1. PHP Final - This is a very simple, custom cms designed within the laravel framework. It allows publishing of individual articles,
               content areas which can contain many articles, css templates to style content areas, and pages which can contain many
               content areas. It also has a basic login system, registration system, user permission levels, and management of users 
               by administrators. This is designed to work with mysql and sqlite databases.
2. Screen Saver - A java gui application which simulates and screen saver consisting of multiple bouncing shapes, generated randomly
                  upon mouse click. This utilizes a collision detection algorithm to allow shapes to bounce off one another, as well
                  as each screen edge.
3. Subnet Calculator (1st year) - A windows forms application developed in VB.net which calculates subnets.
4. Vid Player (2nd year) - An android application which allows the user to populate a sqlite database with videos that exist on their
                           device, and then play the videos. Users can specify a video file, thumbnail file, and video name. Deletion
                           of videos is partially implemented.
5. Zombies (2nd year) - A C++ application which demonstrates object oriented design, particularly polymorphism. This is designed to 
                        simulate a zombie apocalypse. The human and zombie classes inherit from the organism class, and each one
                        contains rules for breeding/multiplication. Gamespecs.h contains all game settings which can be edited.
